**→ Problem section**

## **Learning Arabic could be so hard**

(but it’s not your fault)

If you've tried to learn Arabic, you probably found it very challenging. That's because most resources:

**X Teach Standard Arabic**

It’s the formal Arabic of news and textbooks only. The moment you say “Marhaban” people know something is off.

**X Focus too much on Grammar**

They get you to memorize dry charts and complex rules that make you overthink every word.

**X Present Irrelevant Content**

They teach you useless sentences you will never use in a real conversation. "The duck loves the water."

## But I’m here to help

*I spent **2,500+ hours** trying all the methods, so you don't have to!*

### **Hala walla 👋🏻 I'm Osama, the instructor of this course.**

For the past few years, I've worked with 100+ expats in Riyadh and GCC who wanted one thing: to speak the Saudi dialect people actually use here.

Together, we tried everything. Some methods worked—but painfully slow. Others wasted weeks before we realized they led nowhere. And a few worked like magic!

Over the 2,500+ hours of lessons, I kept refining my method—keeping what works, tossing the rest. By late 2025, my waitlist had grown to 170+ people, and I knew I couldn't help everyone one-on-one.

## So I built the Foundational Course!

A self-paced program designed to take professional expats in Riyadh from zero Arabic to confidently handling everyday conversations in Saudi dialect.

2,500+ hours of teaching experience, condensed into one comprehensive program—so you skip the trial-and-error and do it right the first time.


**→ Benefits section**

## **You will start using Arabic in Riyadh**

Here's how this course gets you there:

(icon 1)

### **Saudi Dialect**

Not textbook Arabic. The actual dialect used in Riyadh's offices and streets—so people don't switch to English when you talk.

(icon 2)

### **Intuitive Method**

Learn through sentence patterns instead of grammar charts. Your brain naturally "absorbs" the logic without the overwhelming rules.

(icon 3)

### **Relevant Content**

Real-world dialogues, stories, and monologues designed to match your level as an expat in Saudi—not random sentences you'll never use.


**→ Social Proof section**

**→ Our method section**

## Our Method

Why do most methods fail?

Most courses fail because they force you to memorize rules and solve quizzes about them. They treat language like Math.

But research shows that **language is acquired, not learned**. And acquisition only happens in one way:

> *Listen → Understand → Repeat with something slightly more complex.*
> 

*That's it. Your brain picks up the language when you consume lots of messages you actually understand.*

But there are three conditions for this to work:

1. **Volume** — You need *lots* of listening.
2. **Comprehension** — You must understand 70–90% of what you hear.
3. **Progression** — The content needs to gradually become more complex.


### How our course uses that?

To speak natural Saudi dialect, your brain needs to be flooded with messages it understands. This course is built on a specific **Learning Loop** designed to feed your brain exactly what it needs:
(here insert the illustration found in /images/foundational/learning_loop.png)

**STEP 01**

### **Structured Lessons**

These are short, focused lessons that **decode the patterns** of the Saudi dialect.

We don't bore you with abstract grammar. We just present you with sentences that will help you quickly get a pattern of Saudi Arabic.

**STEP 02**

### **Comprehensible Input**

**This is the most important part.** You will listen to high-volume, relatable content designed specifically for **Expats in Riyadh**.

It uses the **"i+1" Principle**: The input is always *just* above your current level, so you understand the message but naturally absorb new words and grammar without trying.


**Why is our Input Different?**

Most listening materials are either too fast (native TV) or too boring (children's books).

Our input is **relatable to YOUR life**. You'll hear stories about offices in Riyadh, ordering from local cafes, and navigating Saudi traffic. Your brain *wants* to understand it, so it *acquires* the language faster.

### **"But… what about speaking practice?"**

I’m glad you asked.

Speaking practice is so important. However, as a beginner, you should spend **80% of your time listening and comprehending**, and only **20% speaking**. If you try to speak without enough input, you're just translating poorly from English in your head.

**Does this course include speaking sessions?**

This offer focuses on the core 80%—giving you the massive input you need. It does not include live sessions.

*However, when you're ready to speak, we'll share resources and recommendations to help you set up the other 20%.*


**→ The curriculum section**

## **What's actually covered in the course?**

**Great question!**

Here's what this course curriculum look like:

- **1) 👋 Your First Words in Saudi Arabic**
    
    This is where your journey begins. You'll learn the greetings Saudis actually use — not the textbook "Marhaban" that instantly marks you as an outsider. We'll cover polite expressions, numbers from 0 to 100, and how to introduce yourself with your name, age, and nationality. You'll also pick up **essential learner phrases** — like how to ask someone to repeat themselves — so you're never stuck in silence. By the end of this unit, you'll be ready to walk into any room and greet people with confidence.
    
- **2) 🗣️ How to Introduce Yourself**
    
    Now it's time to go deeper. You'll learn how to talk about your background, your job, and your daily life — in **both past and present tense**. We'll cover how to tell time, use time expressions, and describe your routine. You'll be able to say things like *"I moved here two years ago,"* *"I work at a tech company,"* and *"I usually wake up at 6."* This is the unit that transforms you from "someone who knows a few phrases" to **someone who can express *who they are* and *what their life looks like*.**
    
- **3) ❓ How to Have Real Conversations**
    
    Talking about yourself is great — but real connection happens when you ask about *others*. In this unit, you'll master the question words that unlock conversations: *what, where, when, how, and who*. You'll learn to ask people about their jobs, their routines, and their lives — and you'll understand their answers. We'll also cover **possessive pronouns** (my/your), so you can say things like *"How's your day?"* or *"Where's your office?"* By the end, you won't just be speaking Arabic — you'll be **building rapport**.
    
- **4) ☕ How to Handle Everyday Situations**
    
    This is where Arabic becomes *useful*. You'll learn how to order at a café, ask for what you need at a restaurant, and navigate a grocery store — all in dialect. We'll cover **polite and direct requests**, so you know when to say *"Could you please..."* and when to just say *"Give me..."* You'll also learn how to ask for help and offer assistance to others. After this unit, you'll have the essentials to handle common transactional situations with confidence.
    
- **5) 👫 He , She & What's Happening Now**
    
    By now, you can talk about yourself, ask others questions, and handle everyday situations. Now it's time to expand — and talk about **the people in your life** — your boss, your colleague, your spouse, your kids. You'll learn **third-person conjugation** (he/she), **possessive pronouns (his/her)**, the **ongoing tense**, and a rich set of relationship vocabulary. You'll be able to say things like *"My manager is wearing a Thobe"* or *"My daughter is sleeping.”* This unit opens up an entire new dimension of expression.
    
- **6) 📍 How to Navigate & Give Directions**
    
    In this unit, you'll learn **adverbs of place** — words like *next to, in front of, behind* — and how to ask for and give directions. We'll also cover practical scenarios like gas stations, car workshops, and what to say if something goes wrong on the road. You'll learn **negative commands** ("Don't turn here") and higher numbers for prices and addresses. By the end, you'll have the foundations to handle basic navigation in Arabic.
    
- **7) 👥 How to Talk About Groups & Plurals**
    
    Arabic has special forms for "we," "you all," and "they" — and in this unit, you'll master them. You'll learn how to talk about what your team did, what your family is doing, or what "they" said. We'll cover **plural nouns** and group possession (our, their). This is the unit that lets you move beyond one-on-one conversations and start talking about **the bigger picture**.
    
- **8) 📅 How to Make Plans & Discuss the Future**
    
    In this unit you'll learn the **future tense**, how to read and say dates, and expressions like *"next week," "in two months,"* and *"when I arrive."* Whether you're scheduling a meeting or making weekend plans, you'll have the language to express it. This unit also covers the **verb "to be"** — a slightly tricky piece of Arabic that unlocks more natural-sounding sentences.
    
- **9) 🏠 How to Describe & Compare Things**
    
    This unit is all about expressing the details. You'll learn how to use **adjectives** properly — including where they go in a sentence and how they change based on gender. We'll cover **possession structures** so you can say things like *"my friend's car"* or *"the company's office."* And you'll learn **comparatives and superlatives** — how to say *"better," "the best," "bigger," "the most important."* After this unit, your sentences won't just be correct — they'll be **expressive**.
    
- **10) 🔗 How to Connect Your Ideas**
    
    This is where your Arabic starts to sound *polished*. You'll learn the **linking words** that make your Arabic flow: *if, because, but, that, therefore*. You'll learn the basics of **conditionals**  (*"If I have time..."*), **"have to"** expressions (*"I had to leave early"*), and the connectors that tie your ideas together. These small words make a big difference in how natural your Arabic sounds. By the end of this unit, you'll be ready for real conversations — not just survival phrases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **When will the course launch?**
    
    The first units will be available in **early February 2026**.
    
    This is a **pre‑order** and a **beta launch**, and as a founding member, you’ll see the content early and your feedback will help shape the final version of the course.
    

---

- **Why only 10 people can join the course?**
    
    This is a beta launch, and I want to test the course recorded materials and improve it with the feedback of a fewer number of people before making it available for everyone!
    

---

- **What happens after I apply?**
    
    During this **beta period**, I can only accept **10 founding members** in the first batch. All applications will be reviewed, and I’ll choose the people for whom this course is the best fit right now.
    
    If you’re selected, I’ll confirm your spot, send payment instructions, and add you to the founding members group.
    
    If you’re not in the first 10, you’ll still get access to the full course a few months later, once it’s ready for the wider launch.
    

---

- **How much time do I need each week, and how long does the course take?**
    
    You’ll make good progress with about **3 hours per week**.
    
    Most learners complete the course in **3–6 months**, depending on their schedule and pace. You have **lifetime access**, so you can go faster or slower as needed.
    

---

- **Will this course make me fluent?**
    
    This is a **foundational course**. This course will **not** make you fully fluent, but it will give you a **strong foundation** in Saudi Arabic.
    
    Inside the course, you will learn **almost all the essential grammar rules** you need to speak Arabic in daily life.
    
    By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:
    
    - Introduce yourself and talk about your background
    - Handle common daily situations (work, cafés, shops, directions, etc.)
    - Have simple conversations with Saudis
    - Understand basic spoken Arabic in clear, everyday contexts
    
    After this Foundational Course, there will be **two follow‑up programs** — an **Intermediate** course and an **Advanced** course — for learners who want to keep going and reach higher levels of fluency. Fluency comes with more time and more input.
    

---

- **Do I need to know how to read Arabic, or can I learn without reading?**
    
    You **do not** need to read Arabic to start this course.
    
    Inside this Foundational Course, all Arabic is written **fully in Arabic script**.
    
    During the lessons, **I read every Arabic sentence out loud**, so you can rely on **listening only** and still follow the course, even if you don’t read.
    
    However, skipping reading will usually make your progress **slower in the mid and long term**.
    
    Learning the script is a small, one‑time investment (about **10–20 hours** for most learners) that unlocks a lot of extra potential: you’ll be able to read signs, menus, messages, and every line of Arabic in the course much more easily — and your overall progress will be smoother.
    
    You can watch this [**free 3‑hour YouTube reading course]** to learn the Arabic script if you want to!
    

---

- **What if I already know some Arabic or have studied Standard Arabic (Fus‑ha)?**
    
    If you already know some Arabic, you will probably **move faster**.
    
    - If you know a few phrases or have taken a course before, this program will **organize what you know**, fill in gaps, and give you a clear structure.
    - If you studied **Fus‑ha (Standard Arabic)**, this course will show you the **Najdi dialect** people actually speak in Riyadh, so you can finally follow real conversations.
    - If you’ve already covered all the beginner topics of the Saudi dialect (you know all the tenses, essential grammar rules, and the most common 500 words) then this course might not be the right level for you.

---

- **Which dialect does this course teach, and will I be understood in other Saudi cities Gulf countries?**
    
    The course teaches **Najdi Arabic** — the dialect spoken in **Riyadh and central Saudi Arabia**. It is widely understood across the country and is often used in professional settings.
    
    If you live in places like **Jeddah, the UAE, Qatar, or Kuwait**, people will still understand you to a large extent. Gulf dialects share a lot of vocabulary and structure, so the foundation you build here will transfer well, even though each city has its own “flavor.”
