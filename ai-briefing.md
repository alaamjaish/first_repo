# AI Briefing: Landing Page Build Task

## What This Is
You're building a long-form sales landing page for an Arabic language course. The content is provided in `content.md` (~416 lines). The user wants **Tailwind CSS**, **bold/high-energy style**, and **NO purple colors**.

## Critical Technique: Section-by-Section Building

**DO NOT** try to build the entire page in one shot. Research shows this leads to poor results.

### Why This Matters
- Large content exceeds optimal context processing
- Quality degrades when AI processes everything at once
- Section-by-section approach produces significantly better output

### How To Execute
1. **Build the HTML skeleton first** - Just the structure with empty sections
2. **Complete ONE section at a time** - Don't move on until it's perfect
3. **Each section is a separate focused task**

## Sections To Build (In Order)

1. Header + Hero (lines 1-17)
2. Problem (lines 18-35)
3. Instructor intro (lines 36-59)
4. Benefits - 3 columns (lines 60-83)
5. Social Proof/Testimonials (lines 84-131)
6. Method explanation (lines 132-188)
7. Curriculum - 10 units (lines 189-268)
8. Target Audience (lines 269-307)
9. Pricing (lines 308-321)
10. Bonuses (lines 322-341)
11. FAQ - accordion style (lines 342-416)
12. Footer with CTA

## Key Best Practices

1. **Chunk content logically** - Split by sections, not arbitrary cuts
2. **Keep blocks 100-300 tokens** - Optimal for processing
3. **Iterate, don't batch** - Perfect each section before moving on
4. **Use placeholders for images** - User will replace later
5. **Mobile-responsive from the start**

## Content File
`content.md` - Read only the lines needed for each section, not the whole file at once.
